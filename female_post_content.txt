First Stephen Hawking, then this. :( ' . I saw these two from a distance. An elderly lady and a little girl by her side holding on to her. The lady seemed to be asking for help from people walking past her. People, being too immersed in their lives, werent paying any attention to the two. As I approached, a middle-aged man stopped in front of her. The lady pointed at her stomach and the girls mouth quietly shouting "hunger". The man burst into tears, sat down, pulled a handkerchief out of his pants and covered his... eyes with it. The tears didnt stop though. I was now standing only some feet away watching things unfold. The man got up and asked the old lady if she would give him an opportunity to buy them lunch. The lady joined her hands as tears started to trickle down her cheeks. The man whose tears hadnt dried yet used his handkerchief to wipe away her tears. He looked around and found a restaurant nearby and took them there. I followed. The man sat them on one fine family-sized table and ordered biryani for both of them. He then walked up to the mini-fridge, took out two fruit juice bottles and placed them before the lady and the girl. The old lady prayed for the man and the man left. The tears washed away and smile took over.  This broke me down. Big time. Baa Khudda, life can not be anything else. See More ' . I mean, Tiger Zinda Hai. ' . So, remember to look up at the stars and not down at your feet. Try to make sense of what you see and wonder about what makes the universe exist. Be curious.

On such fine connections is our universe built!  ' .  ' . Deeply saddened by this. RIP.  Stephen Hawking, modern cosmologys brightest star, dies at age 76' . Shit. Absolute shit. If there were a competition of the shittiest ever performances in a football match, ours would still be the shittiest in that. And that would be an understatement. No defence, no midfield and no attack. And THAT is an understatement. We might as well have not shown up for this. But, thanks to this we wont be facing a potential mauling further up the competition facing the likes Real, Barca, City and Bayern. Never deserved to go through.

Still Modi govt claim to be good for women safety. Its not about BJP all political parties in this country make...s pre election promises and after coming in power they escape using religion as political tool. Crime against women committed by politicians belonging to all parties  ,number of such politicians \u20ac\u201c12 \u20ac\u201c is from the BJP, the party ruling at the Centre and most of the states. When people accused of such crimes are given tickets to contest as people\u20ac\u2122s representatives, and then win elections too, how much intent can we expect the administration to show in cracking down on crimes against women, attractive slogans notwithstanding? How does one explain this? Tickets to stand for elections are given after much consideration and calculation, selection and elimination. Accusation of rape, however, seems not reason enough for rejection. Criminality in Indian politics is not uncommon. In a scenario where fear and money are widely used tools to get votes, candidates with a criminal past have clear advantages \u20ac\u201c they have influence in the area, they have money to fill the party\u20ac\u2122s coffers, to campaign, and if need be, to buy votes. It is true that the government or the political class cannot alone make India safe for women. However, they are supposed to lead the charge \u20ac\u201c they have the power to not just formulate laws and policy, but also influence public opinion. If this class is full of crime-accused, not only do women have no one to take up cudgels for them, the men get terrible role models to look up to. How can you expect  harsh punishment for those who are discussing these policies and laws. See more ' . The periodization and categorisation of rape. Dear Indian politicians and jurists tell me what you called this brutal act happened with the girl age of 13 and above. You decided death punishment for rapist if he committed crimes with the girl below the age of 12. What signals are you sending. Hold a second and think about these horrendous crimes that are rising on alraming rate. Dont make rape a political tool, it is crime and more importantly these are rising rapidly. Dont... give choice or categories punishment, make it for all cases. If you are truly concerned with the women of this country.What will it take to stop the increasing cases of rape and sexual violence in India? There do not seem to be any easy answers, especially in a climate where sexual violence has become normalized and capital punishment against offenders has now become selective. Kathua, Unnao, Surat, Manipur, Delhi- the stretching list of gangrape cases across the nation has enraged people. Last time, something like this shook peoples conscience was in 2012, when Nirbhaya was brutally gang raped in a moving bus in Delhi. The sad part is nothing has changed, even after so many promises were made at that time. In this country where it becomes usual phenomenon and happen even in minutes. According to a report by child rights NGO CRY, sexual offence is committed against a child in India every 15 minutes and there has been an increase of more than 500 per cent over the past 10 years in crime against minors.

Listen her when she was in opposition. Look at there attitude when they are in power, ridiculous. ' . Rape culture, the most common phenomenon in India. Rape culture is a sociological concept used to describe a setting in which rape is pervasive and normalized due to societal attitudes about gender and sexuality.Here it becomes a new normal, because of the Behaviour of individual as well as socitel concincise. Behaviours commonly associated with rape culture include victim blaming, slut-shaming, sexual objectification, trivialising rape, denial of widespread rape, refusing ...to acknowledge the harm caused by some forms of sexual violence, or some combination of these. The notion of rape culture has been used to describe and explain behaviour within social groups, including prison rape and in conflict areas where war rape is used as psychological warfare. It is believed that rape culture manifests through the acceptance of rapes as an everyday occurrence, and even a male prerogative. It can be exacerbated by police apathy in handling rape cases, as well as victim blaming, reluctance by authorities to go against patriarchal cultural norms, as well as fears of stigmatisation suffered by rape victims and their families. Other sociologists posit that rape culture links non-consensual sex to the cultural fabric of a society, where patriarchal worldviews, laced with misogyny and gender inequality, are passed from generation to generation, leading to widespread social and institutional acceptance of rape.To some, the root cause of rape culture is the domination and objectification of women. Recent horrific and brutal crimes are wake up call for the nation to have a stringent laws to dealt with such inhuman acts. After the Kathua and Unao incidents which shook the nation with terrible jolt, news from Surat and Jharkhand also gives us clear indication to have some effective measures and laws to prevent these horrendous crimes.

To speak effectively, we must arrive at some understanding of the term nationalism. However to be truly useful such understanding cant be derived exclusively from one specific culture, religious belief, or ideology for that matter. What I am proposing here is a re-examination and reconceptualization of public understanding of word nationalism. My aspirations is to arrive at new definition, that should be free from any coercive interference, since nationalism is emotional attachment of an individual to ones place of birth, where he/she born, brought up and acquired social values and customs over period of time.

By Tony Francis Please held the nerve and read this. When the custodian of law turns breakers of law. "The bar association of Kathua had tried to obstruct the police from filing the chargesheet in the horrific rape and murder case of an 8-year-old child from the nomadic Muslim tribe of Bakherwal. The investigation of this crime was already marred by political interference, with BJP ministers and MLAs, Chowdhary Lal Singh, Chander Prakash Ganga, Rajeev Jasrotia and Kuldip Raj ...attending a rally in support of the accused. The lawyers stalled the chargesheet filing for 6 hours, making a mockery of the judiciary, due process, and the idea of justice itself. Just a few states south of Jammu & Kashmir, Unnao saw another Shakespearean tragedy unfold. A Dalit woman and her family who had accused BJP MLA Kuldeep Singh Sengar and his accomplice of raping her tried attempting suicide outside Chief Minister Yogi Adityanath\u20ac\u2122s residence. As the police prevented them from doing so, they took her father into custody. He\u20ac\u2122s dead now. Justice, with the S.K. Mahajan judgment, might be a dim dream for this family. In the middle of the furor this death caused, a smiling Sengar on his way to meet the CM said, \u20ac\u02dcArrey wo nimn star ke log hain, apradhiyon ki saazish hai.\u20ac\u02dc \u20ac\u201c \u20ac\u02dcThese are people of a lower standing, and this is a conspiracy against me.\u20ac\u2122 Dear Asifa I am completely shocked and bereaved after knowing the brutality u suffered. I know u were only a eight year old innocent child but still u were kidnapped, drugged, tortured, gang raped for three days in the temple and then strangulated to death. The demons did such a heinous crime because they wanted to terrorise your community so that they vacate from that area. I know u were too young to even understand the animosities among the hindu and muslim communities and thats why I am ashamed and feel responsible for your sufferings because as a human being we have miserably failed to make this world a better place to live in. I will not ask u to forgive us because further more we will also be failing in providing justice to u even after your death because our consciousness is now dead. Few years ago we at least had little bit of consciousness left when we came on the road seeking justice for Nirbhaya. But now we have stooped to a level were we hold our national flag in hand and come out in support for the bloody monstrous instead of seeking justice for the victim. All such inhuman act is now being accepted as a new normal things in our New India. My heart is weeping out by just thinking at the unendurable pain u went through. I cant even plead u to forgive us because u were not the last one to suffer. Such heinous crimes we wl again do and afterwards we will again proudly chant Jai Shree Ram/ Allah ho Akbar. May God grant you justice for the cruelty of the uncivilised monsters,  you had to endure at such a young age". See more ' . Psychology RIP '

Written some years ago. "Disclaimer Although every effort will be taken to write this blog in a understandable English yet if found any difficulty, author shall not take any responsibility for the same... :D Introduction Getting inspired from Big B (not Bachchan but Brother), I also thought of starting a new inning in the field of blogging... At present being a novice blogger, I will try to keep my blogs SSS (Short, Sweet and Sexy)... This first blog is dedicated to intro of myself. I am Anshul Gupta, pursuing B.tech from R.N. Modi Engineering College, Kota in Informaton Technology trade In short, I am just an another Ordinary Guy. In my opinion, writing a diary is much more simpler task than writing a blog as then you do not have any shortage of ideas and incidents... Also you can become as personal as you like, as foolish as you want to be and much more... Secondly diary is meant for oneself while blog is meant for others. Hence to write your ideas and life experiences keeping in view not to become very personal is not an easy task... Every task demands commitment, patience, dedication and above all interest in it. Before writing this blog I was in the 7th sky while thinking about my writing and thinking skills but now I have realized that experience counts. To change an idea into process and then process to product require a huge amount of effort. Lets understand this idea by taking an example of an engineering student:- Before admission in a college, an adolescent is just like a sapling who now has to undergo in a vigorous process of unbearable mental and physical tortures for 4 years, sometimes being 5 years (My university is a living example where you have to wait for at-least 9 months for an result)... In 1st year he lands up in the hands of seniors for whom he is just an another prey... then for whole 4 years he is continuously molested mentally by the so called Profs, Lecturers, H.O.Ds, Wardens, Office Staff and some time even by Chapraasees (My colleges a living example where every person employed by the management thinks himself as the God of Universe)... And after a long 4 years of vanvaas he can proudly call him as an engineer/doctor.. Now I have to go as my mother is getting more and more furious" ;) See More ' . Happy frndship day to all !!! ' .

Married? No kids?!  Frequently asked questions, if you have a career, if youre married, if you have children. Like if life was some kind of grocery list. No one ever asks us if were happy. Reminds me of the quote from The Little Prince: Grown-ups like numbers. When you tell them about a new friend, they never ask questions about what really matters. They never ask: "What does his voice sound like?" "What games does he like best?" "Does he collect butterflies?". They ask: "...How old is he?" "How many brothers does he have?" "How much does he weigh?" "How much money does his father make?" Only then do they think they know him. Those nosy questions SADLY are very common among our muslim community making us uncomfortable or sometimes even miserable especially if "no husband yet?" or "no kids???" interrogations are too frequent. Do no live by standards of others but be happy with what Allah has decreed to you. Theres a wonderful freedom in living life by your own design and making choices for yourself. If youre happy, you dont necessarily need to have career, family and kids, a car. Youre just happy because you are content with what Allah decreed for you!

Your days and nights will be with her. When you awake from your sleep, her face will be the first you see. When you retire to bed, her eyes will be the last you fix your eyes on. All the highs and lows of life will be shared with your spouse. When you are in need of a shoulder to cry on, her shoulder will be ever ready. Your smiles and laughter will be in her arms. From all the women on the s...urface of the Earth, the ideal woman is the one described in the following ahdith: The world is a collection of treasures. The best treasure in this world is a righteous wife.[1] (Sunan Ibn Mjah hadith no.1855) The Prophet salallahu alaihi wasallam said in another hadth: After taqwa (Allah consciousness), a Muslim does not benefit from anything more than a pious wife. If he orders her to do something, she obeys him. When he looks at her, she is pleasing to him. If he takes an oath, she fulfils the oath. If he is absent from her, she safeguards herself and his wealth.[2] (Sunan Ibn Mjah hadith no.1857) Do not melt in front of beauty. Beauty is in the eye of the beholder. Seek a spouse who has true values and ethics; a woman who loves Allah and His messenger salallahu alaihi wasallam; a woman which would wake you up for tahajjud salah; a woman who would encourage you to spend in the cause of Allah; a woman which would encourage you to give your life for Allah. External piety and righteousness is not sufficient. What is meant by piety is true piety; a piety which stems from the heart and bears its fruits on the physical limbs. Piety revolves around good character. A person is not attributed with piety by merely performing salh, fasting in the month of Ramadhn and offering zakh. You want a spouse who is gentle, sweet, soft, loving, tender, caring, affectionate and compassionate. Her heart is moved if she sees you in pain. Her world turns upside down if a tear rolls on your cheeks. Her happiness is pegged on your happiness. However, this does not mean you do not consider beauty and physical appearance. You should be physically inclined and attracted to your prospective spouse. Being attracted to ones spouse compliments the marriage in mysterious ways. Thus, we advise you to seek the following in a spouse: 1) True piety 2) Mesmerising character 3) Pleasant appearance With all this said and done, it is equally important if not more that we make a conscious effort to rectify ourselves. A woman desires the same features in a man. A marriage will not reach the peaks of felicity by merely one spouse being righteous. A marriage is like a bird; it needs two wings to elevate; piety is required from the husband and the wife in order to reach lofty stations. We make d to Allah he blesses you with a pious, loving, sweet and attractive partner. Ameen.

While she was praying to her Lord, her mobile rang.... She picked up saying :assalamu alaikom wa rahmatullah wa barakatoh A voice of a young man replied :wa alaikom assalam wa rahmatullah wa barakatoh! Can I speak to (so and so) please? The Muslim girl said :sorry brother, you have dialed the wrong number...Then she hung up. After few minutes, her mobile rang again. She picked up, it was the young man who called her minutes ago. He told her :I called again to apologize for disturbing you! You seems to be good girl! Can I know you better? The girl was shocked for few seconds but then she replied: brother Fear Allah! you suppose to be at Masjid praying salatul Ishaa but here you are going after girls to flirt with them at night! Here you are disobeying your Lord instead of obeying HIM! Shame on you!!! After saying these words, she immediately hang up. Few days later, he called her again:  assalamu alaikom wa rahmatullah wa barakatoh sister, plz dont hang up! I want to apologize again and inform me that I went back to pray all my 5 daily prayers at Masjid! All praises to Allah and thank you for waking me up from my neglectfulness! Plz, can I know the name of the one through whom Allah guided me? I really need someone like you in my life to strengthen my Iman and support me to stay on the right path! Plz help me sister, may Allah reward you for that! She didnt reply and started to think : should she accept to help him to stay on right path? Should she accept that he will be in touch with her from time to time to help him strengthen his Imaan? She heard a satanic voice whispering :he is good guy now! Why are you so worried about it?! let him call you... you both have pure intention! He really needs you! If you refuse his suggestion, he will go astray and it will be your fault!!  She was about to tell him her name but suddenly a little voice whispered :Allah is watching you It was her conscience which woke her up from making a big mistake! sorry brother! she replied finally :if you are sincere in your repentance then you will find people who are better than me to help you! Even I need someone who helps me to stay at the right path more than you! At Masjid, you will surely find many righteous brothers who would be the good company which help you to get closer to Allah! Plz if you really fear your Lord now and afraid of HIS punishment, then do not call this number ever again! Assalamu alaikom wa rahmatullah wa barakatoh! then she hang up and she went back to her Salah mat rising her hands to make this Duaa: O Allah, Turner of hearts, make my heart firm on your Deen and save me from the evil of Fitnah, Ameen. See more ' . I really believe that we are killing our selves with THE USAGE OF MOBILE PHONES AND SOCIAL MEDIA. I see parents sitting next to their children waiting in line or in a park and each and every one of them is on their mobile updating statuses, checking Instagram or tweeting. They dont talk to each other, they walk and text, they drive and text. I HAVE ALSO FALLEN INTO THIS MANY TIMES AND HAVE FELT THE PAIN OF THIS. SO IM TALKING FROM MY EXPERIENCE and how I feel. You finish yo...ur salah and you check your mobile to see if you missed anything. You walk on the street and you check your mobile. You are at work and you check your mobile. There are hundreds of updates every minute. We lose our time and do not even open the Quran for a fraction of that time. The Shaitan has locked us down on this and made us worry about other peoples problems. Yes I have tweeter and Facebook and Instagram and thats why I feel this way. I know many dayees have these social media platforms and they are doing great work. BUT - 99 percent of people do not do any dawa and only watch and check and go back and forth and like and dislike and argue sometimes and waste time. In the Muslim countries, it is a disease. Instagram has swept most people and caused them to fall prey to narcissistic tendencies. Selfies are a proof of how infatuated we are with ourselves. Again I speak from analysing myself and looking at how I feel sometimes. No doubt we have to take a picture or two here and there, but there are people who are constantly taking selfies and showing their bodies - brothers and sisters uncovering what Allah ordered to cover only to get a few likes - it shows that we are in need of attention, in need of love and recognition, while at the same time that we are getting it in the wrong way. I advise everyone and myself first to reduce time on social media and if you are on it use it for beneficial things. Start a dawa program where you reach out to people and not some kind of FAN CLUB for a Muslim speaker or dayee. Our social media MUSLIM SPEAKERS pages are becoming fan clubs. People making weird appealing comments and blunt proposals as if these people would be some kind of super stars. Remember that everything we write and we say is being recorded by the malaika.

Someone would become the engine and others would become bogies. Every day these children used to take turns becoming the engine and bogies ... But there was one small boy wearing only a half pant who used to hold one small green cloth in his hand and become the guard dai...ly. Once I went to him and asked him .."beta, dont u also wish to become an engine or a bogie some time ? He softly replied .." Sir , I dont have a shirt to wear so how will the other children catch me to make the train? I could see the slight wetness in his eyes. It gave me a lesson.... he could have cried and sat at home and abused his parents for not affording to buy him a shirt. But instead he chose another way to play and enjoy. In life, we dont get all things we desire and we keep complaining ..I dont have a bike, I dont have car , I dont have this or that etc.  Life is like that ....we need to make it beautiful and be satisfied with what we have ..

GROWING LONG NAILS and using nail polish or other beauty accessories. Today i would try to discuss a little about Long nails and its permission in Islam. if you have any information or hadis about it or if you do not agree with me your comments are warmly welcomed.... First of all cutting of nails is a part of fitrah and as Hazrat Anas ibn Malik(R.A) narrates that prophet Muhammad S.A.W told that there is a limit set for keeping nails long and it cannot be left for more than 40 days. If it is not haram than atleast it is makrooh, and also if you keep long nails you are surely not following sunnah because according to Sunnah it is must to clip off your nails every friday and if you keep long nails you are against "Sunnat-ul-fitrah". Also with long nails our wudu is not acceptable as water doesnt touches the root of our nails properly and so our namaz will be not a perfect one. It not even allowed if your husband likes long nails. Islam is a religion of cleanliness and long nails are surely an obstacle in the way of cleanliness, long nails trap very much dirt inside them and breeds beacteria and germs also, just consider dirty germs crawling under your nails and youll surely feel bad. no matter however neat and clean you keep them they are dirty though. Hazrat Zaid Bin Arqam Narrates that prophet Muhammad (S.A.W) said he who do not trims his bodily hairs, do not clips off his nails and do not trim his moustaches is not from us. The Prophet (   ) has mentioned few things that are Human Nature, according to a Hadth recorded by Al-Bukhari, Muslim and others. Among them is the Cutting of the Nails. So, growing long nails is against the Sunnah of the Prophet(   ), as well as the Sunnah of all other Prophets and is also against human nature. Muslim women, before adopting a trend or fashion, should check it according to the Islamic Shariah and not blindly follow the non-Muslims.... If death does overtake in this state of beauty accessories,severe punishment in the hereafter. See more ' . Kumar Rajeev Ranjan IAS is new Director of school education kashmir ' . Lesson FOR All A kindergarten teacher had decided to let her class play a game. The teacher told each child in the class to bring along a plastic bag containing a few potatoes. Each potato will be given a name of a person that the child hates. So the number of potatoes that a child will put in his/her plastic bag will depend on the number of people he/she hates. So when the day came, every child brought some potatoes with the name of the people he/she hated. Some had 2 potato...es, some 3 while some up to 5 potatoes. The teacher then told the children to carry the potatoes in the plastic bag with them wherever they go for 1 week. Days after days passed, and the children started to complain due to the unpleasant smell let out by the rotten potatoes. Besides, those having 5 potatoes also had to carry heavier bags. After 1 week, the children were relieved because the game had finally ended. The teacher asked: How did you feel while carrying the potatoes with you for 1 week? The children let out their frustrations and started complaining of the trouble that they had to go through having to carry the heavy and smelly potatoes wherever they go. Then the teacher told them the hidden meaning behind the game. The teacher said: This is exactly the situation when you carry your hatred for somebody inside your heart. The stench of hatred will contaminate your heart and you will carry it with you wherever you go. If you cannot tolerate the smell of rotten potatoes for just 1 week, can you imagine what is it like to have the stench of hatred in your heart for your lifetime? Moral: Throw away any hatred for anyone from your heart so that you will not carry burden for a lifetime. Forgiving others is the best attitude to take. Negativity about someone will keep peace of your mind away from you. Remember the good things about him/her, and let go of the hatred. See more ' . When a husband is rude, abusive and bad tempered: the wife is told to have sabr and reminded what a good muslim wife does. But when a wife is rude and bad tempered: the husband is told to find a more pious wife, she is told women dont act this way and her character slandered. Why dont anyone give this advise instead? ...  It is reported that a man came to Umar ibn Al-Khattab (radhiAllahu anhu) to complain about his wifes ill-temper. While he was waiting for Umar to come out of his house, he heard Umars wife scolding him and Umar quietly listening to her, and not answering her back. The man turned around and started walking away, muttering to himself: "If that is the case with Umar, the leader of the believers, who is famous for his uprighteness and toughness, then what about poor me?!" At that moment, Umar came out of his house and saw the man walking away. He called him and said, "What is it you want of me, O man?" The man replied: "O leader of the believers, I came to complain to you about my wifes bad-temper and how she nags me. Then I heard your wife doing the same to you, so I turned around, muttering to myself, If that is the situation of the leader of the believers, then what about me?"  Umar replied, "O my brother, I bear with her because of her rights over me. She cooks my food, bakes my bread, washes my clothes, breast-feeds my child...and yet none of these are her duty; and then she is a comfort to my heart and keeps me away from forbidden deeds. Consequently, I bear with her." The man said, "It is the same with me, O leader of the believers." Umar said: "Then, O my brother, be patient with her, indeed this life is short. (Adh-Dhahabi, Al-Kabir 194)   You cannot live perfectly happy married lives. This is not Jannah, thats the reason why you got together to achieve it. Youll argue, youll disagree. Youll dispute, bicker and squabble. But in the end thats the point of it. You learn to live and you learn to tolerate. You are marrying a human being!

Muslim girls who refuse to swim with boys denied Swiss citizenship   Yes you heard right, theyre at it again  Authorities in Switzerland have rejected the naturalization application of two Muslim girls who refused to take school swimming lessons with boys present, the latest move to deny citizenship to those who decline integration with Swiss culture. Candidates for Swiss citizenship must prove they are well assimilated and respect local customs.... Omg  first the fines against Muslims that refuse to "handshake" and now theyre denying citizenship on the grounds of maintaining religious beliefs!!! Wow never thought wed see the days of hitlers return. So basically the drill is if they wont accept the decadent western values then simply threaten them. So many western nations have adopted these harsh draconian measures against #Muslims in a bid to strip them from their obedience to Allah!! But you know what its just not happening!! Muslims will not sacrifice their relationship with Allah by going against the commands of the #Shariah. These countries are pathetic,all harping on about freedom and protecting human rights yet when it comes to Muslims and their "rights" to practise their Islamic faith, these so called values of humanity become obsolete !! May We as an #Ummah stay strong against the forced deviance against Allah and continue to hold onto our values,even if it means having to clutch on to hot coal in order to worship the "one and only" ALLAH. The Messenger of Allah     informed us: "After you there are going to be days of patience. The patience during that time is like the one clutching on to a hot coal. During those days the reward for the one who adheres to the Commands of Allah will be equivalent to the reward of fifty men who did an action like his." See more ' .  hicaller.com' .

Govt is on oneside busy with celebrating anniversary of massacre of Jailanwala bagh but on the other side killers of humanity are enjoying their services in district kupwara.. Justifying colonial opperesion of british rule.. ' . YOU JUST HAVE TO PERSIST AND FIND IT!!! Once there was a man who did not make it to university. His mother got him married. After the marriage, he worked as a teacher in a primary school. Due to the lack of experience, he was squashed by the students in less than a week. When he returned home, his wife dried his tears. She comforted him with these words. You should not be too sad about it. Probably there is a more suitable job waiting for you out there.... Later on, he found another job and before long he was fired due to his slowness. This time, the wife commented. There are always people who are skilful and non skilful. Some have experience from their years of work. As for you, you were in school all this while. So, how could you acquire these needed skills? He went for a number of jobs but never stayed long in those jobs. Each time, he would return home with a dejected spirit. His wife would always comfort him and never once was she disappointed or resentful. He was in his thirties when he acquired a flair in languages. He became a counselor in a school for the deaf and mute. Later on, he opened a school for the disabled. A few years later, he set up chain stores in different cities and provinces selling apparatus & equipment for the disabled. He became a multi-millionaire. One day he asked his wife. When I was looking bleakly at my own future, whats the reason that you had so much faith in me? His wife gave him a very simple reply. She said,  When a piece of land is not suitable for planting wheat, we could try planting beans. If the beans are not growing well, we could try planting fruits or gourds. If the vegetation is not economical, we can instead scatter buckwheat seeds. These seeds will one day bloom into flowers. On this land itself, there will be one seed that will germinate and grow. After listening to his wifes explanation, he cried. His wifes faith, love, patience, and persistence is likened to the one seed in the land. This is the seed that persists and creates the miracle on this piece of land. "In this world, theres no person who is useless. It is just that they have not positioned themselves firmly in the right place" Allah swt does not create useless creatures. There is ALWAYS some purpose/mission. You just have to persist and find it!!! See more ' .  hicaller.com'

Become a Blood Donor on Facebook' . Taj terror attack has become a massive psychology case study in Harvard. Not ONE Taj employee abandoned the hotel and ran right through the attack. They helped guests escape and many died . It confounds psychologists . Finally they pin pointed 3 recruitment strategies 1) Taj did not recruit from big cities , they recruited from smaller cities where traditional culture still holds strong 2) They did not recruit toppers, they spoke to school masters to find out who were  most r...espectful of their parents, elders , teachers and and others .3) They taught their employees to be ambassadors of their guests to the organisation not ambassadors of the company to their guests . The results are stupefying . The Indian army too does not recruit toppers, they recruit people through intensive psychological testing, perhaps that is why they have one of the most effective govt organisations in the country , unlike bureaucrats recruited for being topers but suspect psychologies . This has implications on parenting too See More The Ordinary Heroes of the Taj Hotel: Rohit Deshpande at TEDxNewEngland'

happy friendversary little bro ' . Heart broken, Photo of 4 years child who is migrating from Syria to Jordan, the UNHCR team caught him when he was migrating alone in desert from Syria to Jordan.  the only thing he had in his shopper were the clothes of his mom and sister,who were killed in Syria.#PrayForSyria ' . She asked him, How much are you selling the eggs for? The old seller replied, Rs.5/- an egg, Madam. She said to him, I will take 6 eggs for Rs.25/- or I will leave. The old seller replied, Come take them at the price you want. May be, this is a good beginning because I have not been able to sell even a single egg today.

They ate a little and left a lot of what they ordered. Then she went to pay the bill. The bill costed her Rs.1,400/-. She gave Rs. 1,500/- and asked the owner of the restaurant to keep the change. This incident might have seemed quite normal to the owner but, very painful to the poor egg seller. The point is, Why do we always show we have the power when we buy from the needy ones? And why do we get generous to those who do not even need our generosity? I once read read somewhere: my father used to buy simple goods from poor people at high prices, even though he did not need them. Sometimes he even used to pay extra for them. I got concerned by this act and asked him why does he do so? Then my father replied, "It is a charity wrapped with dignity, my child See more '

Indian state has unleashed war to kill its poorest people. Why this war, because there is fight.Fight against all renegades of big capitalists,those big bureaus that build upon the flesh and blood of poor who belong to the countries rich in minerals. In all these decades none bothered about the hinterlands of this country except from those rebels who became doctors  to save people from everyday disease , engineers to build a locality ,guards to save own people from enemies. Now in the combing operation launched by state ,22 people died.The 22 people of our land who fought the state battalion forces to save our land from perpetrators.  There is a media and civil society blackout.Hope they too wake up.They too write.They too fight the apolitical intellectual souls.#IndianStateKillsPoor ' . Its a war in India 16 rebels are killed in a combing operation by this very potent state organed with CobRas and Greyhounds.Action against poorest to the poor people is so "resolute"that democracy shakes in no time in the bellies of no rice and rotis.

See more ' . Via Vernon  Police going to absurd lengths to cook up false charges against organisers of the Elgaar Parishad. They are now using a photograph which appeared almost two years ago in the Indian Express as evidence. In January 2018 the Maharashtra ATS falsely implicated some workers and trade union activists under UAPA and are now trying to cook up the same type of stories against those who were raided on 17th April 2018.... Sudhir Dhawale of the Republican Panthers Caste Annihilation Movement told The Indian Express that while he did know Golala and some of his associates, police were \u20ac\u0153cooking up false charges\u20ac against them. He said it was a group called \u20ac\u02dcFriends of Sridhar\u20ac\u2122 that had organised the programme in Mumbai to mark Sridhar Srinivasans death anniversary. \u20ac\u0153I have worked with Sridhar in the past. So, I participated in a programme to pay tribute to him. What is wrong with that? Police are cooking up false stories and saying I organised this programme\u20ac. Ramesh (Golala) was also present at the programme. Ramesh and others have been arrested on false charges by the ATS. They are associated with the labour movement and were a part of the Bhima Koregaon Shaurya Din Prerana Abhiyan with us. The arrest of these labourers by ATS and searches on our houses are an attempt by this government to crush our movement and protect Sambhaji Bhide, the main conspirator of Koregaon Bhima violence,\u20ac said Dhawale.

This model of people-based politics represents a phenomenon wherein marginalized and disaffected sections outside the realm of conventional political leadership take centre stage of the political discourse.  The rise of such a political move is something that discomfits parties and alliances both on the left and the right.  That is the sole background fac...tor that led to a united front against the hartal.   One has also to take note of the actions taken by police in Kerala, the moment the conventional politicians raise their chorus against the hartal.  The youth who have been arrested across the state number in hundreds.  Many of them were arrested from their homes at midnight.  In Koduvalli, Kozhikode, the hartal supporters have been put in detention on non-bailable charges under Sec 153 A of IPC of causing religious hatred.   Their actual guilt was that they shouted slogans against the Central government.  Does the Left government construe slogans against Modi government as a crime of causing communal friction?

She said to him, I will take 6 eggs for Rs.25/- or I will leave. The old seller replied, Come take them at the price you want. May be, this is a good beginning because I have not been able to sell even a single egg today.... She took the eggs and walked away feeling she has won. She got into her fancy car and went to a posh restaurant with her friend. There, she and her friend, ordered whatever they liked. They ate a little and left a lot of what they ordered. Then she went to pay the bill. The bill costed her Rs.1,400/-. She gave Rs. 1,500/- and asked the owner of the restaurant to keep the change. This incident might have seemed quite normal to the owner but, very painful to the poor egg seller. The point is, Why do we always show we have the power when we buy from the needy ones? And why do we get generous to those who do not even need our generosity? I once read read somewhere: my father used to buy simple goods from poor people at high prices, even though he did not need them. Sometimes he even used to pay extra for them. I got concerned by this act and asked him why does he do so? Then my father replied, "It is a charity wrapped with dignity, my child\u20ac  Share And Spread The Word See more ' .

As the temperature of the water begins to rise, the frog adjust its body temperature accordingly. The frog keeps adjusting its body temperature with the increasing temperature of the water. Just when the water is about to reach boiling point, the frog cannot adjust anymore. At this point the frog decides to jump out. The frog tries to jump but it is unable to do so because it has lost all its strength in ad...justing with the rising water temperature. Very soon the frog dies. What killed the frog? Think about it! I know many of us will say the boiling water. But the truth about what killed the frog was its own inability to decide when to jump out. We all need to adjust with people & situations, but we need to be sure when we need to adjust & when we need to move on. There are times when we need to face the situation and take appropriate actions. If we allow people to exploit us physically, emotionally, financially, spiritually or mentally they will continue to do so. Let us decide when to jump! Lets jump while we still have the strength.\u0178\u02dc\u0160\u0178\u02dc\u0160\u0178\u02dc\u0160 See more ' .

Rumours are circulating Facebook that claim typing BFF into the comments of a Facebook post will reveal if your account is in danger of being hacked. Such messages claim that if the letters BFF appear in green then your account is safe, while if it does not your account is at risk of being hacked. The rumours, examples below, are nonsense, and make no sense whatsoever.... "Mark Zuckerberg, CEO of Facebook, invented the word BFF. To make sure your account is safe on Facebook, type BFF in a comment. If it appears green, your account is protected. If it does not appear green, change your password immediately because it will be hacked".  "Mark Zuckerberg Make sure you do not think about your page or account Type Bff in a comment If it appears green, your account is protected and if it appears normal, you must change the password. Try it"  While it is true that typing BFF into Facebook does [usually] result in those letters turning green, this is in no way indicative of your account being (or not being) at risk. It doesnt even make any sense to introduce such a bizarre and arbitrary method of determining if your account is at risk. Whats happening in the case of the letters BFF turning green is that they have been chosen by Facebook as a special comment that, upon being typed, produce a brief visual animation to appear on the screen. The letters colloquially mean best friends forever. Facebook has other special comments, including Congrats (or Congratulations) that turns orange and shows a brief visual animation as well. Thats literally all there is to it. See more ' . Hike invitations send karne wale be kuch alag he level ke gareeb hote hain. ' .

In my opinion indian agencies want to create fear among Kashmiri masses so that their attention gets diverted from the ongoing freedom struggle. The game started in some parts of india but the main focus was to create disturbance in Kashmir. The people who may be involved in this may be forces personnel, thieves against whom cases are registered, beggars, or sometimes common Kashmiri who may be paid to do this work. It i...s obvious that police is silent in this case and is doing nothing to nab the culprits. They need to understand that their family members may  be attacked too, they should come out of deep slumber and provide their support to Kashmiris. If this continues, we may see different gimmicks which  would be worst than present situation of Braid Chopping just to show to the outside world that the situation in Kashmir has improved.

As we have already indicated that masters of these agents have ordered them to implement GST in Jammu Kashmir state this is well understood by the fact that NC boycotts one meeting and attends another meeting that is held for the same purpose. Every leader and organizations of Jammu Kashmir are playing their roles to create confusion among people of Jammu Kashmir to implement GST. No one can deny the fact that Indira-Abdullah accord 1975 have damaged Article 370 but still Art...icle 370 gives Jammu Kashmir a special status in Indian Union which is clear by GST implementation in all the states of India except in Jammu Kashmir. Even if Article 370 is just a skeleton, still it differentiates between Jammu Kashmir and other states of Indian Union. We condemn the statement that Article 370 is a mere skeleton and needs last rites for its burial. There is no difference between this statement and statement of BJP and RSS regarding Article 370. This statement helps present state government to sustain. Grading of issues related to Jammu Kashmir state is only a way to create confusion among people of Jammu Kashmir.

Teachers have the power to encourage, discourage and shape the young minds of their students..I have had experience with all. But I was also lucky enough to have my fav teacher (hilal sir,Mudasir sir,Irfana Baba ,and Sadaff Khan) who taught me how to strive for my dreams, how to push through when its hard, how to succeed and how to fail and how to dream..              This is a "thank you" to all the teachers out there who are encouragers and lovers of knowledge. You are greatly appreciated. You are the shapers of minds.....             When I come to my daily routine,I go first infront my inspiration Mr hilal sir,and ask him now this day will full my dreams....                  Thks all...... ' .

Dear Students (rather Ex students ;-) ) of  MCA Batch 2013, I have no option but to say you, "Good Bye". I believe it  was among my best times of calling myself a teacher. Because With you, I felt the joy that Moses could feel upon Mount Tur & Alone, I drown, like Pharaohs army entering the Nile. I know because of our highly faulty educational setup, your condition right now will be like: Koi Umeed Bar Nahin Aati; Koi Soorat Nazar Nahin Aati // Hum Wahan Hain Jahan Se Humko ...Bhi ; Kuchh Humari Khabar Nahin Aati. But somehow I believe that you will make it through. You have got enough knowledge and skill to crack the system and find a place for yourselves. Look who is saying and what... "Ye Kaisa Shakhs hai Kitni hi Achchhi baat kaho // Koi Burai ka Pahlu Nikal hi leta hai ". Comming back to the main topic: Musafir hain Ham bhi Musafir ho Tum Bhi // Kisi Mod Par Phir Mulaaqaat Hogi  And some time in the future,whenever you can sneak a moment or two; do come back to tell me the stories of your success - for in your success lies our lives fulfilment.

Abha Khanna u have been a part of happiness and sorrows, of victories and of struggles, of good and bad, of brightness and dullness, of togetherness and separation. What didnt changed when everythg around me was ever changing was YOU. I am glad to have met you, even happier to be friends with you. I loved all the shades that i saw of urs from a caring friend to being a moral science teacher. From a drunk on the road to lending a shoulder to cry. You understood what i said but best was when u comprehended what i never use to say.. Happy married life to u#cusoon#iknow m late again ' .

Leave best wishes message for my bff in the comments if you read this entire looongg post ! Found this on Web, this echos exactly what I wanted to say to you Abha please do read this when you have time *** Open Letter To My Best Friend on Her Wedding Day****... To My Very Best Friend, Tuesday is your wedding day and I couldnt be any happier for you as you embark on the next stage of your life with the man you love. As I sit and reminisce on our journey of friendship and all we have been through together, I am reminded of just how important you are to me; how much I love, respect, and admire you. However, this friendship we share will inevitably change after this day; how could it not? But this does not sadden me, and I am thrilled to be standing next to you for the moment your future begins. Here are a few things I want you to remember Tuesday, the day of your wedding: It is going to be a whirlwind of pictures, flowers, dresses, emotions, and most importantly, joy. Remember to take in it all in slowly, and breathe. Dont get lost in the craziness of the day, remember to enjoy and appreciate these moments that youll remember for the rest of your life. I know it will be your happiest day to date, but its okay to feel a little sad as well. As you remember your nearest and dearest who unfortunately cant share the celebrations with you, know they are watching over you and smiling. We may not be able to help yearning for the people we wish were celebrating with us and thats okay. Because, although not physically in attendance, these people WILL be a part of your day. They are with you, and always will be. We are all so proud of you. Your family, friends and especially me, are unbelievably proud of the person you have become. Everything you have achieved thus far is well-deserved, and a source of constant inspiration for me. Youve always been so confident, determined and successful in accomplishing your goals and dreams. Above all, I hope you remember how much fun your big day will be. It will be easy to get caught up in the scheduling, timing, and stress that your wedding day holds. Dont forget that at the end of the day it is about you and your worthy prince. Everyone you love is celebrating with you and the love of your life, as you two embark on your greatest adventure yet. For now, try your best to get some sleep  Tuesday is a big day. It is going to be beautiful; all of the hard work you have done will certainly pay off and I cant wait to be by your side, watching you live the fairytale we always talked about All my love, Nikita See More ' .

Im proud of my hard work. Working hard wont always lead to the exact things which we desire. There are so many things Ive wanted that I havent always achieved. But, I have strong faith in almighty god and great satisfaction in the blessings of my parents, siblings and all relatives, who instilled a great work ethic in me both personally and professionally. I also thankful to my friends, colleagues and well wishers, they support me during my difficult times. Finally after spending 4+years, I became Dr. Naushad Varish, the special credit goes to my Guide  Dr.  Arup Kumar Pal  who support me during many up and down situations. I am always thankful to him for his consistent support, motivation and encouragement during my PhD time.

Silky Malik Gera  ' . #Feeling Ashamed #Growing Kids #Enjoy Life By Stealing #Dont Bother About Others #No Regrets They May Have  Saturday morning Dussehra i.e 30th Sep17 was a pain & annoying. Around 9:50 a.m my sister was in Rickshaw to cover 10 mins distance from metro station to home & suddenly 3 youngsters came on honda scooty/bike (white Color) & snatched her handbag. The moment she got the hit on her hand from boys, she shouted but those smart thieves shouted on their peak to run from th...ere. And within seconds handbag was stolen. The incident happened nearby my house lane & was immediately reported at Kirti Nagar Police Station. We had managed to fetch video recordings from one of the neighbors spy camera, however the honda scooty/bike number plate cannot be seen. Police had assured us that matter will be sorted out with the help of recordings found & most important the honda scooty/bike which thieves were riding is new in the market & very few people have bought it till now as not seen on roads yet (this had been a +point of incident) Handbag had filled wallet, Samsung galaxy s7 edge Phone & other important stuff. Sharing this incident because cant only rely on Police as till date have not heard back yet from them & moreover 3 chain snatching incidents on Diwali day was also heard of same place.  This is an alert for everyone that this type of snatching incident can happen with anyone. We really have to be very very cautious. Few pics of thieves with their scooty/bike, mobile phone info from the recorded camera & small video for your reference too. if anyone has seen such bike/scooty nearby and knows the person, Kindly inform me or if anyone comes to you to sell the phone or can report at Kirti Nagar Police Station too. I am not concerned about the money loss or other stuff, but, if we as a team gets successful in finding those thieves, surely a lesson needs to be taught to them in polite way, so that they should not make this as their habit & ruin their future. Please share these pics with your friends & relatives who stay in or nearby Ramesh Nagar & if anyone gets any type of info, kindly call me or inbox me here.

Indian forces not only kill Kashmir people in staged encounters but also pose a serious threat to our forest and water resources to supplement its military bases by occupying thousands of hectares of land.Kashmir is the most militarised zone in the world and thousands of hectares of land are under the illegal occupation of Indian forces.Famous tourist places like Gulmarg are already occupied by a large number of forces and the recent move of installing a Radar System by Indian Air Force and the planned construction of 12 km long concrete road from Gulmar to Afarwat is nothing but a move to further strengthen New Delhis military occupation.Roads and Buildings department has been secretly instructed to look into the matter after officials from Indian Air Force met chief minister Omar Abdullah.A large part of Pahalgam, famous tourist resort in South Kashmir, is already under the Amarnath Shrine Board and now India is planning to do the same with Gulmarg See more ' . happy b.day mr tahir ' .

J&K GOVT JOBS 23 minutes ago via mobile PSC to re-advertise 1289 posts of Asst Professors shortly M.Phill degree holders, NET, SET qualifiers eligible... 12/28/2013 10:37:15 PM Akshay Azad Jammu, Dec 28: The Jammu and Kashmir Public Service Commission (JKPSC) will shortly re- advertise 1289 posts of Assistance Professors following judgement of the High Court in a PIL. Moreover, as per the decision of High Court, all the candidates having qualified M. Phill degree besides those who have qualified State Eligibility Test (SET) and National Eligibility Test (NET) recently, are also eligible to apply for the posts. Sources informed Early Times that on October 3, 2013 the J&K High Court had given the judgment on the Public Interest Litigation, filed by some scholars and others challenging the notification number 09-PSC (DR-P) of 2013, dated 23-03-2013, over qualification prescribed for the posts advertised. The petitioners had contended that PSC has not shown the qualification as per Jammu and Kashmir Education (Gazetted) College Service Recruitment Rules 2008 and had secured stay from High Court. "The High Court has given decision in favour of the candidates and has reportedly asked the Higher Education department to consider the M. Phill degrees as eligibility for the posts", sources said. An official in Higher Education department, pleading anonymity said that the High Court had given its decision on October 3, but the official order was issued some days back. "According to High Court order, all the candidates, having M. Phill degree, are now eligible to apply for the posts", he said, adding that the Higher Education department has asked the JK Public Service Commission to re-commence the process of selection. He further said that according to order, all the candidates who have qualified State Eligibility Test and National Eligibility Test, even after the stay, were also eligible to apply for the posts. Officials in Jammu and Kashmir Public Service Commission maintained that they have received the official letter from Higher Education department recently and would likely to re- advertise the posts. "In few days a decision will be taken by PSC authorities and a new date will be given shortly, to all the candidates to apply for the posts", he said, adding that the candidates who had submitted the application forms, before stay order was issued, would not be required to fill application forms, again. Pertinently, the PSC had advertised 1289 posts of Assistant Professors on 25-05-2013 but on June 6, 2013 Jammu Wing of the J&K High Court has ordered stay on the said notification.S Tahir Ahmad, Mudasir Wani, Fayaz Naikoo, Sohail Yousuf Wani, Mir Ishaq, Gohar Khan, Syed Ansar, Muneeb Ahmad, Parvaz Ahmad, Sajad Ganie, Aashiq Shah, Amjad Amjed Khan Bhatti, See more ' .

Ritika Puri Rruchie Pearl ' . No wonder I could relate it to my man and his edforts to keep me like a princess Prince Jain  ' . Rruchie Pearl Ritika Puri ' . Ritika Puri ' . So true... ' . Some instances teach you so much , while travelling in metro today i came across a mother daughter couple they might be coming from some interview. As I was sitting next to them I got to heard some piece of their conversation. Dont know wt actual conversation was but the way girl was responsibg to her mom like  mom tumhe nai pta interview process kya hota hai jab nai pta ho naa to mat bola karo she was loud enough  to make another two people sitting by her could hear. All ...I was able to see a patient smiling mom sitting after such an insult. I might have used such lines 2-3 times and still that lady was paitient and normal. I wonder wat a blessing we all have in face of parents. In this fast moving era all equipped with technology and new knowledge why we are so rude with our parents why have we forgottent thr fact that where we are standing today its because of them they made us capable of what and how we do things today. And we are disrespecting them that too in public. Being an outsider I felt bad dont know what that lady felt bt could assume good obviously. All I would request everyone guys you are successful enough today ... agreed quite knowledgable too but dont let this thing make you egoistic that you stop respecting your parents . They are already well equipped as per their time all you need to do is hold their hands and make them equipped with your time as they did when you were small dont disrespect them ..... See More ' .  The Strong, Independent Woman That I Am Today Is All Because Of My Father. Thank You, Papa' . Prince Jain ' . Happy womens day all lovely ladies..... on thinking about this day some thoughts came to my mind which I though to pen down and share.... Today we talk about empowering women, what we should do, what we shouldnt do to make them equal in society, to motivate them to empower them. Today we generally talk about hardships a women face, how Indian women is still struggling to be equal to men at work places at home etc. but have we ever taken a pause from all this and though that... actually things have started changing. That today indian women  - we are achieving, are independent , most of us are working to achieve our dreams and some of us are living  our dream and how is this getting possible, is this an effort of just one person or people . If this effort resulting in success then is this happening just with the efforts of a single women or someone else is also involved. Well a single persons success is never his/her own success its because of her efforts and efforts of people around her. If I am independent today its not because I have put in efforts , worked hard and came here its because my family and friends supported me. They stood like strong pillars behind me, they held we when I fell down, they motivated me when I lost hope. They pampered me when I felt tired. Today whatever I am its not just my efforts its my familys efforts as well. Today I just not want to say that we should empower women , obviously we should do that but I also want to thank all those people who have been a constant support in my journey yet My parents who have been my constant support , my inlaws, my friends and last but the most important my husband.. they all have been standing behind me liks a solid rock motivating me to do better each day and fulfil my derams such families and such people are actual examples who are motivating us the Professional women of today to be up to the mark with all her duties be it office or home There is a very famous quote that says behind every successful man there is a woman but today we could also say behind every successful woman there is a man  who always motivates her to move ahead and be successful and for me my husband Prince Jain proves dis quote right he is my motivation to be better each day....  and I want to thank him for all he do...    So Today on this Womens day let us thank our family and friends for their constant support and portray them as examples for those who dont yet  In case you agree with me do thank those people who have been with you in your journey to success and achieving your dreams See More ' .

An elephant took a bath in a river and was walking on the road. When it neared a bridge, it saw a pig fully soaked in mud coming from the opposite direction. The elephant quietly moved to one side, allowed the dirty pig to pass and then continued its onward journey. The unclean pig later spoke to its friends in arrogance, See how big I am; even the elephant was afraid of me and moved to one side to let me pass. On hearing this, some elephants questioned their friend, the re...ason for its action. Was it out of fear? The elephant smiled and replied, I could have easily crushed the pig under my leg, but I was clean and the pig was very dirty. By crushing it, my leg will become dirty and I wanted to avoid it. Hence, I moved aside. *_This story reveals :_* _Realized souls will avoid contact with negativity not out of fear, but out of desire to keep away from impurity though they are strong enough to destroy the impurity._ _You need not react to every opinion, every comment, or every situation._ _Select your path and keep going ahead_ *Choose your battles wisely...

From the tym #NIA acted against Hurriyat leaders for #MoneyLaundering and other cases..the common man has lost the left of faith in Hurriyat leadership..and the only option of supporting hurriyat who according to them were fyting fr the #RightToSelfDetermination was also lost..going by the data..the militancy picked up from time hurriyat was targeted..thus a thoughtout solution by indian policy makers on kashmir actully helped the kashmir cause by making Hurriyat irrelevant and revived militancy in every nook and corner of kashmir..#JustanOpinion ' .

Girl strangulated to death by neighbour for turning down love proposal Pulwama, Apr 15: A 21-year-old girl was strangulated to death allegedly by her neighbour in this south Kashmir district after she turned down his repeated requests for a love affair. The body of the girl, who had gone missing on April 7, was recovered on Sunday from a stream near her residence in Galabugh village of Ratnipora. The girl was strangulated to death by one of her neighbours after she turned ...down his repeated requests for a love affair, Senior Superintendent of Police (Islamabad), Amit Kumar, told reporters here. According to the police, the girl (name withheld) went missing on April 7 from her village. The family, however, said the police lodged a complaint on April 10. The family did not approach us till April 10 after which we started to investigate the case under FIR No 101/2013, SSP said. He said preliminary investigation, which included the phone records of the girl and statements of the family, led the police to one Muhammad Yaqoob Rather, 23, son of Bashir Ahmad of the same Galabug village. After interrogation, Rather confessed to the crime and led us to the place where he had dumped the body of the girl, SSP said. He said the accused confessed that he played a trick and brought the girl to a nearby orchard and after a heated argument, strangulated her using her headscarf. Police have registered a case of murder and further investigations are on, the SSP said. He said police are also trying to ascertain whether Rather is the only one involved in the crime or there is involvement of someone else also. The accused, police say, had been stalking the girl for quite some time and had threatened her of dire consequences if she did not accept her proposal. The family of the girl told us that the accused was seen roaming around their house on the evening their daughter went missing, said a police official. See more ' .

Teach your kids the importance  and beauty of Eid Ul Fitr & Eid Ul Azha in their lives. Exchange gifts and wear the best you have in the wardrobe. Eat good and remember poor & needy. Just erase unnecessary occasions like birthdays from their lives except for necessary documentations where mentioning  date of birth is mandatory. Let them understand and acknowledge the truth.  Besides being bid\u20ac\u2122ah and having no basis in sharee\u20ac\u2122ah, these birthday celebrations also involve imitat...ion of the Jews and Christians in their birthday celebrations. The Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said, warning us against following their ways and traditions: \u20ac\u0153You would follow the ways of those who came before you step by step, to such an extent that if they were to enter a lizard\u20ac\u2122s hole, you would enter it too.\u20ac They said, \u20ac\u0153O Messenger of Allaah, (do you mean) the Jews and Christians?\u20ac He said, \u20ac\u0153Who else?\u20ac (Reported by al-Bukhaari and Muslim). The Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) also said: \u20ac\u0153Whoever imitates a people is one of them.\u20ac May Allah save us all from the Fitnah of Dajaal. Think over it, only to temporarily enjoy in this world we are destroying our own Aakhirat. Thats a time when we will be questioned and we cant lie. Nor there will be extra time alloted to rectify. It is now or never, here or nowhere. See more ' . Went through this beautiful Hadith a moment ago.  Al-Bukhaari (1877) and Muslim (1363) narrated that Sa\u20ac\u02dcd (may Allah be pleased with him) said: I heard the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) say: \u20ac\u0153No one plots against the people of Madinah but Allah will cause him to dissolve as salt dissolves in water.\u20ac ' .

We have some daanishmand back home who believe a Kashmiri working outside Kashmir has no say in the Kashmir issue. Theres a cream of Kashmiri society living outside Kashmir, working days in days out only to feed their families. Unfortunately we are addressed as the Riyal,  Dirham and Dollar makers. I mean what is exactly the problem? Almost any Kashmiri who gets an opportunity working abroad will come out to financially support his family. Not everybody is lucky or capable... enough to engineer his own set up. Right. Another thing, often are we asked to come back to serve the people back home. Nobody wants to live away from his hometown, especially when the cost of living abroad both financially and psychologically is far too alarming. Fit into our shoes and then play the blame game.

MY NEW INSTALLATION WORK  AT INDIA INTERNATIONAL CENTER.                THE CONFINED CROWD In politics, polarization (or polarisation) can refer to the divergence of political attitudes to ideological extremes.  It also refers to divergence like public opinion or even to such divergence within certain groups.... Media has become a strong force, not for information but a building of opinions.it takes away every right of yours to express or think independently. It also appears that finding out the truth is now lame.  It is as if the whole country is puppet to them, cheap and meaningless debates expose their calibers. People are given to understand the guidelines to think, to act, to determine their business in accordance with state orders or some infamous groups, without any logic and orientation.  The societies have surrendered and are manipulated. The idiot box is over busy with the loaded misadventures.  When watching and listening to these so-called broadcasters with their usual imperfect use of words, one senses that the crowd of the country has been confined in a narrow and suffocated chamber where their culture, care, courtesies, and identities are lost.  There is far-reaching disrespect to the norms of intellectual honesty.  There is a complete shift in political and social narrative now.  Media is mad with dividing policies within the societies, where Foreground is somewhat visible, Middleground is Blurred and the background is in the complete disappearance and the Crowd is left with Confusion and chaos.   -MEDIA--------(Mad Envoy, Dangerous, Insane Aide)---- See more ' .

Dont feel bad if people remember you only when they need you. Feel privileged that you are like a candle that comes to their mind when there is darkness. ' . Washington D.C, Oct 28 (ANI): Couch potatoes, you may want to lessen your TV-time as a team of researchers has linked prolonged TV viewing to 8 leading causes of death in the US. On average, 80 percent of American adults watch 3.5 hours of television per day and multiple observational studies have demonstrated a link between TV viewing and poorer health. The investigators reported an association between increasing hours of television viewing per day and increasing risk of dea...th from most of the major causes of death in the United States. Previous studies had reported a relationship between TV viewing and elevated risk of death from cancer and cardiovascular disease. In this study, researchers at the National Cancer Institute looked at more than 221,000 individuals aged 50-71 years old who were free of chronic disease at study entry. They confirmed the association for higher mortality risk from cancer and heart disease. In addition, they identified new associations with higher risk of death from most of the leading causes of death in the U.S., such as, diabetes, influenza/pneumonia, Parkinsons disease, and liver disease. The results fit within a growing body of research, indicating that too much sitting can have many different adverse health effects, explained lead investigator Sarah K. Keadle. Keadle cautioned that although each of the associations observed have plausible biological mechanisms, several associations are being reported for the first time and additional research is needed to replicate these findings and to understand the associations more completely. The study appears in the American Journal of Preventive Medicine. (ANI) See more ' . happy birthday bro ' . hbd ' .

The Peace Psychologist in Kashmir Helping Women Affected by Conflict' . Lets say you have 10 insurgents. Now, lets say you kill two of them. Now, how many insurgents do you have left? Well, youd say eight, of course. Wrong!... In this scenario, 10 minus two equal 20. Lets say the two insurgents you just killed... each had six friends or brothers... who are hovering on the brink of joining the insurgency... But then you go [again] and kill their friend [or brother]. Now youve just made up their minds for it. Those hovering friends are now full, [invincible] members of the [movement]. And, so, in the math of counterinsurgency 10-2 = 20. -- General Glenn McMahon, War Machine See more ' .

After a long time time Basharat Ali writes  "Militancy in Kashmir erupted after multiple attempts of peaceful renegotiation of relations with India failed. The narrative control that the Indian state has maintained over Kashmir, through its means of knowledge production, and the practices it has adopted to discipline Kashmiri bodies, blurred all colours of the spectrum and created false paradigms to support its militarization in the valley. " Caught Between Sovereign States' . Samreen Mushtaq writes.... "Women may seem far removed from the frontiers where nationalist armies engage in battle; but in todays new wars including Kashmir, where the home becomes the war zone where pellets and bullets fired in the air somehow make their way inside peoples hearths and safe havens women are exposed to the gendered contours of militarization on an everyday basis. Walking through army camps that dot the landscape, subjected to whistling and lewd comments from gun-wielding soldiers, finding their private spaces and personal items exposed to the gaze of soldiers, the constant fear that accompanies the militarized code of conduct, form the normal state of exception." Why do we refuse to hear the 27-year-old story of Kunan Poshpora rape?' . Hours after I removed my post on some friends request which was about V.P candidates remarks on Hindoestan being our mulk, I received messages from at least 15 aligs (probably supporters of v.p candidate) asking me who I am to intervene in Aligarh politics, who the hell I am, who has given me the right to interfere. I wont name and shame them but let me tell you that you cant silence people through language of violence. I cant compromise on my freedom of speech.

Here I review  ProfMansoor Ahmad Mansoors  "Yeh Basti Azaboon Ki"   in Khwab, Khak Aur Khoon, the author has drawn a graphic picture of how people felt during the 1990s when people got themselves shut up in their homes in broad day light. There is silence, both out and inside the house. Every door has been shut up, it looks like people are sleeping in their homes, but the truth is they all are waking, but they are silent. There is no light and sound in this area, if there were no moon light it may appear like black island. If any ray of light comes out from the dark rooms, with in no time the sounds of shoes creates the panic. [Book Review] Tales of Hardships Pangs And Agonies From Kashmir - The Companion' .

Memories  '
As a Kashmiri I feel sad to see my  place mired in  mindless terrorism,hate and  doublespeak. All those who know the contemporary history of Kashmir well will agree that major section of Kashmiris helped thwart designs of Pakistan in 1947 and 1965 to grab Kashmir by sending mercenaries. Up to 1980 despite prevalence of  secessionist sentiment in a section of Kashmiri Muslims there was no endorsement of  violent secessionist campaign by any section.Traditional pro-Pak outfits ...never gained  character of a mainstream outfit.There   are many reasons for that,which need to be detailed some time. What then changed in 1980 and subsequently---  *sponsorship of violent jihadism by  countries like Saudi Arabia  and Pakistan in the context of oil boom and American intervention in Afghanistan. *diabolical politics of National Conference and Jamaat Islami,Kashmir chapter * diversion of  local anti-elitist sentiment by regional civil society in to communal and secessionist channels. * erosion of state administration ,both in terms to  provide fair governance as well as safeguarding unity and integrity of the country,  since Sheikh Abdullah took over in 1977 as  head of  ruling   party  * Absence of counter-narrative by national parties and GOI  to contest secessionist ,communal and fundamentalist politics There have been three different phases of radicalisation in Kashmir with differing ideological content and political priorities.   Latest variety is the Salafism propagated by trans-national Islamist outfits  with promotion concept of Caliphate. Majority of new recruits in Kashmir are brainwashed to this ideology. Their goals are not local secessionism but creation of an Islamic caliphate.This is a phenomenon not restricted to Kashmir but seen  globally , where gullible fall victim to this utopia.Pakistan is directly controlling   thr these caliphate seeking terrorist outfits to foment terrorism. Rather than harping on development mantra and allowing half-separatist politics to act as buffer the need is to reach to the local populace by   three methods: * One,  demonstrate that no matter how strong the terrorist campaign   it will be smashed comprehensively.Restraint of Indian state should not be construed  as its weakness.This message needs to be driven home to terrorists. * Two,build a strong counter-narrative to contest disinformation and debunk communal,secessionist and fundamentalist ideologies informing local anti-Indian campaign. * Three,send a firm message to regional mainstream parties that they will be debarred from electoral politics if these appeased separatism in any form. Mere counter-Insurgency campaign is no answer,though military component of terrorism needs to be neutralised effectively to break political and ideological stranglehold of  jihadists on local populace.

' . BL Zutshi ko good morning and Mubarak ' . Many of my friends  who are otherwise  great fans of Modi  ji and BJP  harbour the illusion that BJP is a great nationalist party and  feel OUTRAGED on recent statement by top BJP  leadership that it has no plan to abrogate Article 370 at least for now. Keeping in view track record of Sangh Parivar on J&K since 1947 this outrage is totally misplaced.Except on one occasion --during 1952-53, when great patriot Dr.SP Mukerjeee had decisive say in policy-making and the party laun...ched EK Nishan EK Vidhan EK Pradhan movement for fuller integration of the state in the Indian union,BJP  never pursued  nationalist policy on Kashmir.In fact  many of its policies, particularly  when it was at the helm at the centre, worked against national interests. BJP cashed abrogation of Article 370,ethnic cleansing of Kashmiri Hindus and  expulsion of foreign nationals for votes and political power.It was never serious about these. Collapse of nationalist centre and gravitation of Congress & the Left towards pursuit  of balkanising politics made emotive identity politics of BJP look nationalistic. There is need to refocus on the role of national political parties towards serious issues of national security,J&K and national integration.This will put the desired pressure on these to rectify their serious distorted perspectives and  help reverse anti-unity policies.

But then I just realized that your test report was due. So I right away asked your mom about the result, and then the news brok...e. We were going to be parents. Wondering whom did we dial first to leak the news, its your dearest chacha (Ankush Garg) and chachi (Daman Ankush Garg). Even before I could tell, they right away guessed that its a news about you. We called them to our home. Then we informed your grandparents. And that became your 1st day in our lives. God bless. Praful Agarwal  Rachna Goel See More ' .

For students.... if you hv no questions in your mind, u dont deserve to be a student.. ' . Can someone answer me that why our children are supposed to learn languages (eng, Urdu, Kashmiri, Hindi etc)for 10 to 12 years? And why all these languages? When should we come out of this and should focus on science and technology.. to learn a particular language 3 to 4 years are enough..I think we are far behind adopting a variety of  approaches like project-based learning, problem-based learning, inquiry-based learning, challenge-based learning, passion-based learning, and on and on.. ' . One of the Indian news channel today called Dargah as a place of worship for Muslims.. I m surprised if all the other religions have only one place of worship, how come we Muslim have two (masjid and Dargah)!! ' . Character is how u treat those who can do nothing for u.. ' . the politics of this age is not for ensuring the peace and tranquillity of the humanity,  nor is it for ensuring the prevailing of security and public order. it is based upon the understanding that the great majority of people serve those counties which hold the power in the world... In the language of politics, wording is the opposite of meaning. Oppression has worn the cone hat of justice. Treason has worn the dress of patriotism.. ' . Govt will shift 1st to twelfth exam to March Session from next year... What are your views abt it? ' . Our role is to direct people and to inform them. However, guiding them to accept it and embrace it is only at the hands of Allah. You can lead a horse to water but you cant make it drink! ' . Criticism and negativity from other people is like a wall. And if we focus on it, then we will run right into it. So we should Focus on the Road, Not the Wall.. we can get blocked by negative emotions, anger, and self-doubt... Once Dr zakir Naik said that there are thousands of people who criticize or oppose me but if I start answering them one by one, i will waste all of my time with them and I can never do my own work.. so better is to ignore them ND move forward.. If youre dealing with criticism, then dont let the wall keep you from seeing the road. Focus on the path ahead... If you choose to respond to the haters, then surprise them with kindness. You might just win a new fan while youre at it... ' . We now live in a country where most Muslims know someone who has suffered from Islamophobic hate or abuse. nearly all stories about Muslims are negative. it is clear this is the last acceptable form of bigotry... media plays a key role in the development of anti Muslim hatred...  We are equal members of society and demand fairness, not favours. It is time Muslims should take the media into their own hands, sitting on the sidelines is ineffective. Mainstream media cannot address all the issues for all communities equally, Muslims need to actively work to educate journalists... ' . Mostly students dont understand the true meanings of education and they just go after key books and notes just to pass the exams. Students do not use their abilities and at the end they are just capable for clerk jobs. there is no need to change the course books but the scope of minds of the students should also be change. Our goal is not to be the landlord of any town or village rather we have to live in this world and compete with others. The world listens to him who knows the code how to live in this world. ' . It is important to have a role model for better career.. Looking to someone successful for inspiration is great. It makes us determined to achieve something similar and helps to guide our career choices... Teachers play a very important role in shaping students future career choices. We think of teacher heroes that taught us the academics but we dont often think of those teachers that taught us lifes lessons... ' . unfortunately under current regimes that control education and teachers, day after day after day they are working to appoint teachers with secular thoughts, who consider Western civilization and its concepts their ideals, so they become committed to that policy in education and curriculum as their devisers want. Motivating our sisters to do unislamic and immoral activities on some occasions  like dancing etc is against the teachings of islam.. One of the most important roles of the teacher is to build students personalities, those who view him as a role model... That is why the teacher must be a good example for his students.. Imam Maliks mother advised her son to ask his mentor to teach him morals before taking knowledge from him.. but we are doing opposite.. ' . All the prophets, being human beings, had to undergo tests and trials which resulted in temporary stress. They constantly remembered Allah and received peace through His remembrance. The Prophet Muhammad pbuh, himself used and advised to recite Dua  in times of stress, Allah is sufficient for us, and He is an excellent guardian, and we repose our trust in Allah.. Our losses are a part of trial for us. Whatever we are given is a gift from Allah. We are not their owners. Everything belongs to Allah and returns to Him. So if we dont own these things why mourn their loss. ' . Carving a career path is not about choosing something that is popular, one that everyone else seems to be doing or one that gives you the highest financial returns. For Muslims, it is of utmost importance that we choose the right career path as it is a decision that will affect our productivity... While choosing a career, it is important that we follow our strengths. We should choose a path that is close to our hearts and one that we like... we should Set an example for other Muslims to follow..... always pray to Allah for his help and guidance in all matters. Always pray salaatul Istikhara before taking any action so as to have the will and permission of Allah in every action you take and In sha Allah you will be on the right path. ' . My message to those who dont succeed in todays examination is not to be ashamed of your failures, they dont break you, they actually make you. It might have been an expensive lesson, but if you recover fast, strategize your plan and focus you will be back on track in no time. Failure is not the Opposite of success. It is a part of Success... The opposite of success is learning... ' . education system in our state has had such an approach it almost says This is how it works, you learn it this way," We are imposed what to do and how and when to do it, this educational system which teaches us the answers of everything.... the main drawbacks of our education system are not opening the door for the mind and not allowing for thinking and researching... If you are not curious, you cannot learn anything.The educational system, which does not create demand while  not giving any right to choose and to take initiative, cannot raise persons with high character and free will. ' . We must raise our children two winged.. one is not enough to fly.. If there is a separation between religious edu and sciences & tech, bigotry arises from the first and disbelief from the second... Our education system should be such which will train Muslim youth who will be successful in religious and worldly affairs... ' . Current educational system is incapable of offering any good change. There needs to be a total struggle. From school to University level system has to be changed.. I advocate for such an education system where a medicine student can discuss with a kalam student, a literature student can debate with a tafseer student, a law student can discuss with a student of fiqh... ' . If we want people to behave with us  positively and prevent them from acting badly, the safest way to do this is to appreciate their positive action. ' . In education, how we teach is more important than what we teach.. it is known the students who do not like teacher generally do not like the subject either.. ' . Successful people take risks, but they dont take thoughtless risks...People who want to achieve greatness should take calculated risks... ' . Successful people cant relax on chair. They relax by work.... They sleep with a dream... Awake with commitment & work towards goals.... ' .                      ' .         ...            ... Sheikh Ahmad Deedat.. '

Fb waal apuz wana esi chiii languooti yaar. ' . *Although anger is a natural feeling it can have negative effects on those who allow it to control them, and adverse effects on those around them.  Anger can destroy relationships, health, property, and livelihood.  Uncontrolled anger is one of the tools of Shaytaan and it can lead to many evils and tragedies.  For this reason Islam has a great deal to say about the emotion of anger* And march forth in the way (which leads to) forgiveness from your Lord, and for Paradise as ...wide as the heavens and the earth, prepared for the pious.  Those who spend (in Gods Cause) in prosperity and in adversity, who repress anger, and who pardon the people; verily, God loves the good doers Quran 3:133-134) *5 Ways to Deal With Anger* *1.    To reduce your anger, perform wudu, which cools you rapidly and brings down your temper.* *2.    When you are angry or when you come across an agitated person, at once say, Auduthu Billahi Mina Shaytaan Nir Rajeem (I seek refuge in Allah from the Shaitaan, the forbidden)* *3.    Forgive the wrongs done to you. Why? Because for all the sins we do, Allah forgives us and suppresses His anger. This is stated in the Holy Quran: . . . and He pardons much. [Quran, 42:30]* *4.    If you find your anger escalating, stop and remind yourself that if you dont control your anger now, unhealthy circumstances like divorce, loss, and lifelong enmity are just around the corner.* *5.    Dont move until your anger is suppressed.* *Note: When youre happy, dont make promises; when youre angry, dont make decisions.* See more ' .

Please share this as much as you can: A class 12 boy has shot down his teacher because she was trying to discipline the boy which the boy felt to be a torture. Teachers will not be able to teach freely this way.  Dear parents... A humble request being Extended to one and all. I being a small creature Known as a teacher Proclaimed as a nation builder  I being expected  To shape the future of a child. To make your spoiled child An enlightened one. I also have my life Which is dear to me I do have a family Who need me   Dont expect too much from me If you cant handle your offspring. Better to make them sit at home. The purest of relationships The teacher student bond Has touched its lowest. You expect the potter  To make the best of pots With the worst of lots Without any contact and guidance You want to get an approved licence Without taking a  driving test. Your pampered lad Surely laden with fad and whims. Bound to commit crimes Definitely will be part of heinous acts. To hide your weaknesses You compromise your nonavailability With the supply of costly gadgets These become the weapons To spoil their innocence To rot their fragile sense You make the poor teacher a scapegoat. You need to make an introspection To generate the lost values Is just not my sole and whole duty You all need  to take up A wake up call immediately. #zero_tolerance_in_youth #lack_of_patience #over_pampering_by_parent #parents_wake_up Remember : Teaching is a profession which creates every other profession.

Godbless u n Gurjeet always !  I Luv you Jasleen Malhi ' . KARWACHAUTH FOR AN ARMY WIFE....    Just like last year, he did not accompany you to get mehndi applied on your hands. He did not sit with you while you ate sargi. You dressed up, wore bangles, put on a bindi, knowing well that he  would not look at you and go starry eyed. When you looked at the moon through the sieve, you only had his picture to look at thereafter. All this but you hold no grudge that he was not with you on this special day which is all about him. He is wher...e he is needed more. It is not easy being an Army wife. While people feel you are used to being alone, they dont understand that you never get used  to being away from the one you love the most. You just brave one day at a time, thinking that it is one day closer to the next time you will meet again. But festivals, birthdays and other special occasions.well, they are the most difficult! When you are wedded to the olive greens, nothing is the usual. You dont get to click selfies with your husband on Karwachauth, ask him to pamper you or take you out for a movie or shopping. The day is  about the sentiment- the wish for his well being. While your man braves out adverse conditions at the border, you just pray for his health and safety. You miss him badly but understand that his life is harder. You just believe in supporting your man in arms and letting him know that while you may not serve, you are with him, every step keeps you strong and going!

However difficult life may seem, there is always something you can do, and succeed at. It matters that you dont just give up. #stephenhawking ' . Madness is an absolute prerequisite to a happy and successful life. Dont ever treat your little insanities as if they are aberrations that ought to be hidden from the rest of the world. Acknowledge them and use them to define your own way of living the only life you have.

After the break-up, the gus penis becomes small & the girl becomes a hoe. Secrets go public & heartbreak becomes denial. ' . Him: Did you cum? Me: Yes, to the revelation that Im definitely going to have to use my vibrator after this shit. ' . Men always ready to settle down when that erectile dysfunction kick in ' . All these dudes talking about replacing their girlfriend with a sex doll --- thats fucking great --- youll probably have more in common since youre both dead weight. ' . Ladies you owe nobody a tight P**sy. In 2018, its survival of the fittest. Let whoever cant swim drown. ' . The reality that keeps younger women clinging on to their virginity and older women running towards the protection of celibacy is that sex is rarely looked back upon as a good decision when youre a female. ' . I would love for a guy to walk on the outside of the sidewalk, hold my umbrella, walk me to the door, kiss me and leave. But I know today... those expectations are rare. The equivalent of that is getting a follow-on insta or maybe a like. And I hate that thats what its come to but you can either adapt to things as they change or wish they were different. See more ' . Dick aint worth it if it disrupts your peace. Get better dick, positive dick, loving fuck, a dick thatll cherish you Ma. ' . For all the shit talk average women do about how men arent all that, most are guilty when it comes to placing certain men on pedestals based on Market Value. ' . No man is too busy for pussy, but some are too busy for a relationship. ' . Men are motivated by sex, but that doesnt mean you go Dutch to avoid owing him sex. Even if you pay on the date hes still going to try for it, and you may still sleep with him. In the end, you just paid for half your date and gave up all your pussy. Who wins? ' . Theres no one more thoughtful, friendly and sweet than a dude trying to fuck you for the first time. ' . Most women dont date to learn, they date to be liked. Most women dont have sex because he earns it, they have sex because the combination of hormones, fear of him getting it elsewhere, and the pressure he puts on you in private, becomes enough. ' . Women are taught to sacrifice, to play nice, to live an altruistic life because a good girl is always rewarded in the end. This is not a virtue; it is propaganda. ' . Men arent even good at lying. Have you been out lately? Todays males are remarkably idiotic, yet they still manage to get whatever they want by exploiting smart women with those weak lies. Look at the world of compromise thats been allowed. Netflix and chill is considered a real date. "Hey, are you coming out to the bar tonight?" is courting. "Let me just put the tip in," is poetry. And Side chick has become a viable relationship title. Men arent held accountable for play...ing games; they are held onto tighter, and a generation of women wont do a damn thing about it but go to war with each other to see whose Instagram picture can attract the cutest loser.  All of this empowerment talk, but few women actually live in power. They live in worry of if a guy will call them or not. They buy into lies they know are lies because they imagine a love waiting for them that will be worth the struggle. That weakness makes my stomach turn.  See more ' . Youre horny, and he pushes all the right buttons, thats what you like about him! Ladies arent allowed to communicate these thoughts because the status quo has determined that a sexually expressive woman is a slut. Instead of saying, "I want to fuck him." A proper young lady is supposed to say, "I want to be his girlfriend." This is slut-shaming 101, brainwashing that makes girls see Love when its only Lust. ' . In this day and age it would be naive for a man to think that women are just having sex with just pure emotions. Sometimes, we just need to get it off too... 100% physical. ' . Ask a hundred different women why they fake their orgasms, and you are likely to get a hundred different answers, but here is the thing. Its not the lie that matters. Its that women feel that they have to.  And gentlemen, thats on you. ' . Men are encouraged to objectify our bodies but the second we search for sexual satisfaction; ooh baby, we are called whores!! ' . Happy Monday. Glad I woke up NOT pregnant. At least this gives me something to look forward to today  ' . Men do not fear commitment. Men fear being broke, and never having their cock sucked again. Its just that simple. ' . Lets just fuck and say goodbye  ' . Booty calls typically start between 1am and 2am. If you get a text after 3am, you werent first on the list. #OnlineRebel ' . So how do you men like your women these days???  Society is so fucked up, I can tell what works nowadays.  Like is it okay to tell that guy you like that you enjoy being chocked during sex and want to call him big zaddy or should you wait for him to make the first move and be nice and shy for the taking??? ' . I love how guys talk about erections like its something they bought at the store and cant take it back. #NiggaPlease ' . Is sex really the highest prize a man can hope to attain?  I think people should stop overrating sex. A woman can sleep with a man and still weigh their options on an ongoing basis, as to whether the guy is right for them. #MyTwoCents '

You honour and treat your guests well but when they leave, you gossip about them and talk about their flaws. (A leaking bucket) 6. You give alot of sadaqah to the poor but you humiliate them and hurt them. (A leaking bucket) 7. You stand up for tahajjud at night, fast and reads Qurn everyday but you cut your family ties.

I got a good journey of this English Speaking. When my father got transferred from Delhi to a different oil refinery city, for few years. I was scolded by teachers there for not at all having a practice in speaking English.  Thanks to that school, our English speaking skills were honed so much that we started expressing even our anger in absolute English words.  But after that when I came back to Delhi, instead of appreciation I was teased by my mates for  speaking too mu...ch English & by some teachers for Faking good English.  This is for their information, that its not me who is at fault for having something GOOD- its the education system here in Delhi that the rest dont have it.  P.S The small places name is BIHAR.

We all look rugged here but this is special for today. This was the first time, we 4 women took the courage to go for an international tour( with no man with us.) And then there was no looking back  We had our ship tour in it, which takes at least an hour of immigration check, safety drill on ship and so much more. We did all for the tour ( we still do) alone without the help of any man of our house.  And am proud of it!!!... After my euro trip recently, I got a message on my messenger from one of my childhood woman classmate saying " you inspire so much. I wish to go on an only womens tour with my sister. Will you help me?" That was an elating day for me.  I say it every day and will say it till the end- there is no thing that a woman cant do. You just got to take that first step courageously.

When no culprit is yet found, Forensic Psychology gives the solution. ... P.S The ones have a doubt what is the relation between technology and psychology.

DIVISIONS IN THE SOCIETY  The society of the village Palhllan was broadly divided into two groups in the   past, the first group was consisted of the krams like Tantray , Bhat, Wani, Parray   etc. their socio economic states was good as they were engaged in both agriculture  as well as business . The second group consists of krams like ganie , shah, sheikh, Aha-...  -nger, Kumar, Hajam, Dhobi etc. Their socio-economic status was not good . They   were marrying only within their own castes and their tradition is still carried in our   village to a large extent.  But so far as the education is concerned both the groups showed a mixed res-  -ponse to it as a result of which, at present we find these lower krams are holding   various government jobs.   The caste like Ahanger/ Khar, Kumar(Kral), Najar(Chaan), Hajam(Nayed) etc.  were called Nangars i,e they were not holding any land. But at present they used  to practice agriculture, business and other profession as the upper castes of the village  and are also the holders of large tracts of land. besides this most of the families of   these lower castes continued their traditional jobs. They are not looked down in our  village but at present they are respected and honoured as any other family or caste of  the village.Though in our village most of the families continued the tradition of marry-  -ing within their own castes but i,e does not mean that they are looked down by other See more ' . DIFFRENT KRAMS (CASTES) OF VILLAGE PALHALLAN   There are almost 36 krams in village Palhallan. They are Tantray, Bhat,Sheikh,  Hajam, Kumar, Ahanger, Ganie, Dar, Malik, Naikoo, Wani, Mir, Pir, Sofi, Kochey, War   Bhagat, Khan, Yatoo, Malla, Lone, Gojree, Nadaf, Shah, Rather, Khandey, Najar, Dhoru  Qadri, Dhobi, Gashroo, Zargar, Shoosha, Parray, Hakeem....  Tantray kram:  Tantray is one of the dominant krams of our village. While my interaction   With the elders of the village i came to know that the Tantray were the original inha-  -bitants of the village. It is one of the wealthy krams of the village.  BHAT KRAM :  Bhat is also one of the dominant krams of the village Palhallan.They are also  the original inhabitants of the village and are mostly engaged in fruit business it is   one of the wealthy krams of the village.  LONE KRAM:  Lone kram was present in the valley right f rom pre-Islamic times and was   Considered one among the upper castes of Hindu society.lone is a corrupt form of  the Sanskrit word Lavanya.  One interesting feature of the lone kram in our village is that they were mostly the believers of joint family system.Parray kram :  Parray is one of the dominant krams of our village. While my interaction with  the elders of the village I came to know that the kram parray represents two groups   of people. One who were engaged in weaving and the other one represents the   wealthy people of the village. The group which was engaged in weaving was called  Voveir and other group which was wealthy was called  Joo and were mainly   engaged in business.  WANI KRAM :  So far as wanis are concerned they are the merchant class of Kashmir,  they embraced Islam one and all, as none of the pandiths hold this kram   the wanis of village Palhallan are engaged in both business and agriculture.  The wanis of the village Palhallan also represent two groups of people. One is entir-  -ely engaged in agriculture and the other group is engaged with both agriculture and  and business and are economically considered sound than the agriculturist wanis  NAJAR (CHAAN) KRAM :  Najar too was an important occupational caste of the village and they were  rendering their service to the villages by fulfilling their needs. The important manu-  -facture of najars consists of Albani, Yeput, Khraw, Yunder etc. The najars also used  To plan an important role in the construction of houses . Most of these services are  still preferred by najar. But this occupation has been now adopted by the people of other castes of the village as well. See more '
haha titans we were ' . This is how BJP play with peoples mind by always saying something wrong and in time, when actually they have to talk on something else.

My personal  observation on #braid_chopping: I may be wrong. Who will be benefited from all this?  Mujahideen? No Huriyat? No PDP? I think  No... JK Police? No Then who? It is the central Government that will b benefited. This whole drama is executed by central govt with the help of agecies like RAW. The aim is to divert the attention of people from #kashmir_cause. Create a #psychological_threat among the  masses. And main aim is to maling the image of #Kashmiriyat. They want kashmiries to behave like #goons beating and #lynching innocents. They want to show the world bodies that kashmiries are not innocent but are terrorists.  #Shame for state government who have failed to nab the real culprit... See more ' .

Some teachers would fake threat letters of militants against me, says Prof Tareen' . A fathers hear touching words , communicated to a teacher. A complete guide for a teacher and an inspiration in itself.  Letter "My son starts school today. It is all going to be strange and new to him for a while and I wish you would treat him gently. It is an adventure that might take him across continents. All adventures that probably include wars, tragedy and sorrow. To live this life will require faith, love and courage.... So dear Teacher, will you please take him by his hand and teach him things he will have to know, teaching him  but gently, if you can, Teach him that for every enemy, there is a friend. He will have to know that all men are not just, that all men are not true. But teach him also that for every scoundrel there is a hero, that for every crooked politician, there is a dedicated leader. Teach him if you can that 10 cents earned is of far more value than a dollar found. In school, teacher, it is far more honorable to fail than to cheat. Teach him to learn how to gracefully lose, and enjoy winning when he does win. Teach him to be gentle with people, tough with tough people. Steer him away from envy if you can and teach him the secret of quiet laughter. Teach him if you can  how to laugh when he is sad, teach him there is no shame in tears. Teach him there can be glory in failure and despair in success. Teach him to scoff at cynics. Teach him if you can the wonders of books, but also give time to ponder the extreme mystery of birds in the sky, bees in the sun and flowers on a green hill. Teach him to have faith in his own ideas, even if every one tell him they are wrong. Try to give my son the strength not to follow the crowd when everyone else is doing it. Teach him to listen to every one, but teach him also to filter all that he hears on a screen of truth and take only the good that comes through. Teach him to sell his talents and brains to the highest bidder but never to put a price tag on his heart and soul. Let him have the courage to be impatient, let him have the patient to be brave. Teach him to have sublime faith in himself, because then he will always have sublime faith in mankind, in God. This is a big order, teacher but see what best you can do. He is such a nice little boy and he is my son!" See more ' . Dont let other peoples opinion distort your reality .. Be true to yourself .. Be bold in pursuing your dream ..

Hahaha this app is hilarious !! My #family knows it better :P which kashmiri food you love' . Rumours are circulating Facebook that claim typing BFF into the comments of a Facebook post will reveal if your account is in danger of being hacked. Such messages claim that if the letters BFF appear in green then your account is safe, while if it does not your account is at risk of being hacked. The rumours, examples below, are nonsense, and make no sense whatsoever.... "#Mark_Zuckerberg, CEO of Facebook, invented the word BFF. To make sure your account is safe on Facebook, type BFF in a comment. If it appears green, your account is protected. If it does not appear green, change your password immediately because it will be hacked". "#Mark_Zuckerberg Make sure you do not think about your page or account Type Bff in a comment If it appears green, your account is protected and if it appears normal, you must change the password. Try it" While it is true that typing BFF into Facebook does [usually] result in those letters turning green, this is in no way indicative of your account being (or not being) at risk. It doesnt even make any sense to introduce such a bizarre and arbitrary method of determining if your account is at risk. Whats happening in the case of the letters BFF turning green is that they have been chosen by Facebook as a special comment that, upon being typed, produce a brief visual animation to appear on the screen. The letters colloquially mean best friends forever. Facebook has other special comments, including Congrats (or Congratulations) that turns orange and shows a brief visual animation as well. Thats literally all there is to it. See More ' . Observe your duty to Allah in respect to the women, and treat them well ' . Theres nobody in the world that knows me better than my sister. (. . .

This Kent water purifier wasnt working since two days and the service guys didnt answer the call. So decided to fix the issue myself and it turned out that the UV lamp wasnt working because of the badly soldered joints. Easy-Peasy! Also, Kent claims it to be an intelligent/smart *microprocessor* controlled purifier. But, after opening it up completely I could only find a basic 8-bit *PIC16F526 microcontroller* soldered on a single sided pcb with only reasonable build quality. I wonder what is smart in this?

Put a frog into a vessel fill with water and start heating the water. As the temperature of the water begins to rise, the frog adjust its body temperature accordingly. The frog keeps adjusting its body temperature with the increasing temperature of the water. Just when the water is about to reach boiling point, the frog cannot adjust anymore. At this point the frog decides to jump out. The frog tries to jump but it is unable to do so because it has lost all its strength in ad...justing with the rising water temperature. Very soon the frog dies. What killed the frog? Think about it! I know many of us will say the boiling water. But the truth about what killed the frog was its own inability to decide when to jump out. We all need to adjust with people & situations, but we need to be sure when we need to adjust & when we need to move on. There are times when we need to face the situation and take appropriate actions.

Someone graduated at the age of 22, but waited 5 years before securing a good job. Someone became a CEO at 25 and died at 50. While another became a CEO at 50 and lived to 90 years.... Someone is still single, while someone else got married. Everyone in this world works based on their time zone. People around you might seem to be ahead of you and some might seem to be behind you. But everyone is running their own race, in their own time. Do not envy them and do not mock them. They are in their time zone, and you are in yours. Life is about waiting for the right moment to act.

 30 Amazing Pictures of the Wonderful Karakoram Highway' .  27 Most Beautiful Places in Swat Valley That You Must Visit' . Many many happy returns of the day bro... ' . Happy birthday sir ' . Happy birthday dear and many many happy returns of the day ' . A man married a beautiful girl. He loved her very much. One day she developed a skin disease. Slowly she started to lose her beauty. It so happened that one day her husband left for a tour. While returning he met with an accident and lost his eyesight. However their married life continued as usual. But as days passed she lost her beauty gradually. Blind husband did not know this and there was not any difference in their married life. He continued to love her and she also love...d him very much. One day she died. Her death brought him great sorrow. He finished all her last rites and wanted to leave that town. A man from behind called and said, now how will you be able to walk all alone? All these days your wife used to help you. He replied, I am not blind. I was acting, because if she knew l could see her ugliness it would have pained her more than her disease. So I pretended to be blind. She was a very good wife. I only wanted to keep her happy. Moral:- *Some times it is good for us to act blind and ignore one anothers short comings, in order to be happy* *No matter how many times the teeth bite the tongue, they still stay together in one mouth. Thats the spirit of FORGIVENESS.* *Even though the eyes dont see each other, they see things together, blink simultaneously and cry together. Thats UNITY."* *May God grant us all the spirit of forgiveness, unity and togetherness*. 1. _Alone I can Say but together we can Talk._ 2. _"Alone I can Enjoy but together we can Celebrate_ 3. _Alone I can Smile but together we can Laugh._ *Thats the BEAUTY of Human Relations. We are nothing without each other* *STAY CONNECTED* *QUOTE OF THE DAY* The razor blade is sharp but cant cut a tree; the axe is strong but cant cut the hair._ *MORALS*; *Everyone is important according to his/her own unique purpose.... Never look down on anyone unless you are admiring their shoes.....*. Sharing will make this msg more beautiful :) See more '

Long ago i wrote this #poem which was not only a condemnation but an #empathy. I am sharing it once again. MY #ADRENALINE RUSHED My inner self got, a gigantic shock... I will not be able, to talk When I saw their body, #bashed  My adrenaline rushed Sitting in, isolation And thinking about, the situation How they would have been #crushed My adrenaline rushed To protest against, the #tryant I took #pebble in my hand, As no other option was left stranded, My adrenaline rushed As they fire bullets of hate, We have stones to combat, Yet they say, they are crashed My adrenaline rushed By #AFSPA, they can kill It assists as their pill, Numerous cheeks they crushed, My adrenaline rushed Every day is same, As if, it is a game When youths are being bashed My adrenaline rushed For I cried for #peace, But they dont want #Kashmiris, Kashmir they needed My adrenaline rushed By#YASIR #WANI See more ' .

Whenever i come across my #Tableegi brothers my iman gets stronger. Whenever i come across my #AhleHadith brothers my questions get answered in the light of quran and authentic hadith. Whenever i come across #jamaat_e_Islami brothers i get to know more about establishment of deen in our society. We have more than 95% similarities among all groups. Let us focus on them and give no place for disunity with miniscule differences and try our best to unify ummah by eliminating those difference too.

"karimao panne aathe fermao" ' . Are Hartals and Shutdowns only means to remember the anniversary of our #matyrs. I dont think so. Hartal gives us nothing but the curse of poor and makes our leaders more obsolete. Let us remember the #martyrs in our prayers and take care of their families. And pray to Allah to stand us among the rows of matyrs on the day of hearafter. ' . Politicians always #condemn policemen killings whereas Hurriyat always condemn millitant killings. And a Muslim always condemns #innocent killings. ' . Today during Mansar #chalo ' . Probe ordered, case registered--The most abused words in kashmir. Killers kill, we condemn, and Hurriyat (JRL) comes with Hartal. These things are not a solution to stop killings. Let us advise our young brothers to keep away from resisting with stones. Their lives are precious. And let us expect JRL (Hurriyat) comes with an effective advise. They are your sons too. And let us not expect anything from perpetrators. ' .

The Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said: \u20ac\u0153The most truthful of speech is the Book of Allaah and the best of guidance is the guidance of Muhammad, and the most evil of things are those which are newly-invented.\u20ac And he (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said: \u20ac\u0153Whoever innovates anything in this matter of ours (i.e., Islam), that is not part of it will have it rejected.\u20ac (Bukhaari: 2697) ' . So whatever you have been given is but a passing enjoyment for this worldly life, but that which is with All\u0192h (Paradise) is better and more lasting for those who believe and put their trust in their Lord (concerning all of their affairs).

Ibn Umar reported Allahs Messenger (may peace be upon him) as saying: When any one of you intends to eat (meal), he should eat with his right hand. and when he (intends) to drink he should drink with his right hand, for the Satan eats with his left hand and drinks with his left hand.

Kashmir Editors Guild couldnt be more hypocritical. It has conveniently trained its guns at the Indian media while the real culprit in the immediate case of misreporting is none other than the President of Kashmir Press Club, Mr.Saleem Pandit.

The least the KEG can do is to ask Saleem pandit to step down as KPC president.
